        <h2>What causes being underweight?</h2>
        <div class="p1">
            <p>
                People become underweight for many different reasons. Some may be born naturally small and their low BMI is due to their genes. Some may have a very high metabolism and find it hard to put on weight, even if they eat foods that have a lot of calories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some people may not follow a healthy, balanced diet because they forget to eat or they cannot afford nutritious foods. Others may not be eating properly because they are sick, or their medicines make them feel nauseous. Some people who do a lot of physical activity burn up more calories than they can eat, leading to their being underweight.
            </p>
            <p>A common belief is that healthy underweight individuals can ‘eat what they want’ and then burn it off either by high levels of activity or elevated metabolism</p>
